- __My node cli adventure__
  - led by: [Chris DeMars](http://chrisdemars.com)
  - abstract: My small journey, with help or course, to build a cli tool in node, the struggles, and ES6. Don't talk about it, be about it, and just build the damn thing!

- __stop bikeshedding and use npm as your task runner__
  - led by: [Vince Speelman](http://vinspee.me)
  - abstract: Reduce dependencies and simplify the build pipeline by using the task runner that's built into your package manager. Create a tight feedback loop of `change -> compile -> test ùÑá` without needless abstraction.

- __Fun with JavaScript arrays__
  - led by: Michael Matola
  - abstract: Programmatically filling a JavaScript array with values (without using for loops or external libraries), or, the one useful use of the Array constructor (mit apply() special sauce), or, ES6/ES2015 fixes all of this anyhow.
