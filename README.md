- __stop bikeshedding and use npm as your task runner__
  - lead by: [Vince Speelman](http://vinspee.me)
  - abstract: Reduce dependencies and simplify the build pipeline by using the task runner that's built into your package manager. Create a tight feedback loop of `change -> compile -> test 𝄇` without needless abstraction.
